Actions:
- Updated pipeline to support Trusted Publishing (OIDC) by adding job-level permissions `id-token: write` and `contents: read` to `.github/workflows/publish.yml`.
- Updated README to document Trusted Publishing steps and tradeoffs vs. using a secret token.

Notes:
- Workflow change pushed to origin/main. This allows the job to request an OIDC id token; the publish action can now perform the OIDC exchange provided PyPI side has been configured to accept the GitHub identity.
- Next step requires PyPI configuration: add a Trusted Publisher on PyPI and link it to this repo/org, or add a `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret for the simpler token-based publish.
