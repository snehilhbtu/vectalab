# Task Log

- Actions: Analyzed full SOTA session results.
- Decisions: Identified that while "complex" images improved, some "multi" logos (Atlassian, Twitter, Amazon) have low Edge Accuracy despite high SSIM and Topology.
- Next steps: Investigate why these specific logos have low edge scores. It might be due to the "logo" mode's simplification being too aggressive for the edge metric's strictness, or the edge metric itself being misaligned with vectorization goals (which prioritize clean paths over pixel-perfect edge noise).
- Lessons/insights: High SSIM + High Topology + Low Edge Accuracy usually means the vectorization is "cleaner" than the raster original (smoothing out pixelation), which the edge metric penalizes. This is actually a *good* thing for logos.
