# Task Log - Update README with Benchmark Command

## Actions
- Updated `README.md` to include the new `benchmark` command in the "Commands" table.
- Added a new "Benchmarking" subsection under "Usage" in `README.md` with examples for using `vectalab-benchmark`.

## Decisions
- **Placement**: Added "Benchmarking" after "CLI" usage to keep it prominent but distinct from the main conversion commands.
- **Examples**: Provided examples for both custom directory input (the new feature) and standard test sets.

## Verification
- Verified the markdown syntax and placement in `README.md`.

## Next Steps
- The documentation is now consistent with the new functionality.
